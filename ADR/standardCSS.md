## CSS standards

1. Use "_" this prefix for CSS file namings.

  ```
  _buttons.scss
  ```

2. If there should be more than one word in the naming of a stylesheet, separate those words with a hyphen (" - ").

  ```
    _grid-blocks.scss
  ```

3. Import your stylesheet in _index.scss file.

  ```
  @import "text-area";
  ```
